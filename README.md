At the heart of our website, we have used Node.js and Express.js to build a robust and scalable backend. The powerful MongoDB database ensures efficient data storage and retrieval, enabling fast and seamless transactions. With the integration of Stripe, a leading payment gateway, we guarantee secure and hassle-free online payments, providing peace of mind to our customers.

On the frontend, we have employed React.js, a popular JavaScript library, to deliver a smooth and interactive user interface. React Router DOM allows for seamless navigation across different pages, ensuring a fluid browsing experience. We have implemented React Redux and Redux Thunk to efficiently manage the application's state, enabling smooth data flow and enhanced performance. Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, facilitates seamless communication between the frontend and backend, ensuring fast and reliable data transfers.

To enhance the visual appeal of our website, we have incorporated Chart.js, a powerful charting library, to present data in an intuitive and visually appealing manner. React Icons, React Material-UI, and Tailwind CSS provide a wide range of icons, UI components, and customizable styles to create a beautiful and responsive design. We have also utilized React Toastify, an elegant notification library, to provide informative and user-friendly alerts.

For an enhanced shopping experience, we have implemented React Multi Carousel, which allows for dynamic and interactive product carousels, enabling easy product discovery. Additionally, our website supports location-based features with the help of Country-State-City, which provides accurate and up-to-date information on countries, states, and cities.

To provide feedback and rate products, we have integrated React Rating Stars, empowering customers to express their opinions and contribute to the community. Finally, we have optimized the development process using Redux DevTools Extension, enabling efficient debugging and monitoring of the application's state.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
